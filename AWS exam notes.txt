EC2/On-Premises (Elastic Compute Cloud - virtual servers)
	BeforeInstall, 
	AfterInstall, 
	ApplicationStart, 
	ApplicationStop, and 
	ValidateService; for 

ECS, they are (elastic container service)
	BeforeInstall, 
	AfterInstall, 
	AfterAllowTestTraffic, 
	BeforeAllowTraffic, and 
	AfterAllowTraffic; for 
Lambda, they are
	 BeforeAllowTraffic and 
	AfterAllowTraffic


SSD - gp2 volumes iops is tied to volume size
	5.3 TiB - a maximum of 16,000 IOPS

Cognito User pool - Sign in, third party, persist
	Idenity pool - temporary

Security group - Loose - Automatically allows traffic out via an inbound rule (stateful)
Nework ACL - Strict - Must allow in and out explicitly seperateley (stateless)

EBS Volumes - AZ locked
EFS Volumes - Region locked

AWS KMS - up to 4 KB data encyption

sam sync - incremental fast deployment
sam deploy - full deployment
cdk diff - differnces local vs deployed
cdk deploy - deploy stack

Zonal reserved instances - Cheaper, reserved capactiy
Regional reserved instances - Expensive, no reserved capacity

Kinesis Data Streams - High flow, manual increase shards, no transformation
Kinesis Fire hose -  transform data, automatic scaling

VPC Flow Logs - capture traffic info in your VPC. 

AWS CloudFormation valid Parameter types 
		String, 
		Number, 
		List<number>, 
		CommaDelimitedList, 
		AWS::*


o1 EBS volume - size between 4 GiB and 16 TiB, 
		provisioned IOPS between 100 and 64,000
		Same AZ as EC2
		50:1 GiB:IOPS

CloudFront key pairs - 2 per root user
			Private key for URL, public key with cloudfront
CloudFront key groups - you can associate a higher number of public keys

RCU = Count * (size/4KB) (strongly consistent)
eRCU = RCU*2 = Count * (size/4KB)/2
WCU = count * (size/1kb)


SQS - No limit to messages but 120k for in flight messages (not yet deleted from queue)
	Delay queues (postpone delivery)
	Standard queue (at least once delivery, max throughput)
	FIFO queues (Processed once in order they are sent)

SQS scales automatically, lambda can do it on a schedule or automatically

ASG metrics - ASGAverageCPUUtilization, 
		ASGAverageNetworkIn, 
		ASGAverageNetworkOut, or 
		ALBRequestCountPerTarget, or custom CloudWatch

Dynamo DB - 400kb max item
redshift - petabyte-scale data warehouse service

security group - firewall for IP traffic
iam role - permission to resources or services

AWS Security Token Service - temporary IAM access

CodeDeploy - appspec.yml - deployment process
CodeBuild - buildspec.yml - build process

immutable - deployed to new instances, with new auto ASG, min impact
Rolling - in place deployment
Rolling with additional batch - incremental outside cap, longer deploy manual rollback
All at once - classic deploy

--dry-run option checks if have permissions for the action

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store - managing configuration data and secrets, such as database credentials or API keys

DynamoDB has two built-in backup methods (On-demand, Point-in-time recovery) that write to Amazon S3, but you will not have access to the S3 buckets that are used for these backups.

Lambda -To deploy a container image to Lambda, the container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API. No multi-architecture images
	Can scale on schedule to reduce spin up time of the auto scaling

Encrypt - directly encrypts data (up to 4 KB) using a customer master key (CMK)
GenerateDataKey - creates a unique data key for client-side encryption of larger data

WebSocket APIs - real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, persistent connections

AWS X-Ray sampling - control the amount of tracing data to a small percentage of requests

Amazon ElastiCache - for Redis is a fully managed, scalable data replication, clustering, and automatic failover.

Memcached - designed for simplicity while Redis offers a rich set of features that make it effective for a wide range of use cases. 


ECS task placement
	spread (distributes tasks evenly across specified attributes like Availability Zones), 
	binpack (places tasks to minimize unused resources like CPU or memory), and 
	random (places tasks randomly without specific criteria).

Adaptive Authentication - configure your user pool to block suspicious sign-ins or add second factor authentication in response to an increased risk level

RCU = 20(4/4)/2
WCU = 10(2/1)
